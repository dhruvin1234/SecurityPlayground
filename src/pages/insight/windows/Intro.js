      <h1>Introduction to Windows Privilege Escalation</h1>
      <p>
        Windows privilege escalation refers to the techniques used by attackers or penetration testers to gain higher-level permissions on a Windows system. The ultimate objective is often to gain administrative rights (SYSTEM or Administrator level), which allows full control over the machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        This escalation is typically achieved by exploiting weak configurations, software vulnerabilities, mismanaged permissions, or inherent flaws within the Windows environment. Once an attacker has initial access, these techniques help move from a low-privileged user to a high-privileged one.
      </p>
      <h2>Why is Privilege Escalation Important?</h2>
      <p>
        Privilege escalation is a critical phase in penetration testing and real-world attacks. Gaining administrative access allows attackers to dump credentials, maintain persistence, disable defenses, and further pivot within the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        For cybersecurity professionals, learning these techniques is vital to assess and improve Windows system defenses. It helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.
